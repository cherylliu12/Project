    <h1>Top 2. HMCS Yukon - San Diego, California</h1>
Location: San Diego,California<br>
Basic Information: The HMCS Yukon was a Candaian destroyer escort, 366 feet long and 40 feet wide, with 6 decks and over 100 compartments. It is Part of San Diego’s Wreck Alley — a series of six artificial reefs — this Mackenzie-class destroyer purpose-sunk on July 14th, 2000 now lies on its port side at a depth of 100 feet. Aside from a slightly tricky orientation, the 366-foot-long wreck is ideal for penetration thanks to numerous entry and exit points cut into the steel hull. <br>
Inside the Yukon is a maze of tunnels and passageways. Many access holes are cut into hall, so the diver will never be more than 30 feet away from an <img src="../Project/project images/hmcs.jpg"alt="hmcs"height="200"> It has been estimated that in order to explore the whole Yukon, it will take about 30 dives. Divers will explore at approximately 80 feet, and it is also dark down there because not all access holes to the ship face to the sun. No.5 and No.6 dive decks are particularly dark.

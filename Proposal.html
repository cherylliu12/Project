    <p>
    This Website will be about Top 10 diving sites in U.S territory.The objective of my website is to provide a background these diving sites, and animals specifically to these sites. This site could serve as a guide for divers interested in exploring the undersea world of America. My target audience would definitely be divers or people interested in exploring diving. The first page will be a introduction to diving; second page should be overview of rankings, the next 10 webpages will include specifics to the top 10 sites and next will be a contact page.
